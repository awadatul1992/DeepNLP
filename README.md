# DeepNLP
This repository contains the jupyter notebooks to learn natural language processing where in the 
input text is processed using Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK) library and different methods used to encode the text into integers.
We started with naive methods of representing input text to numbers like BOW, TF-IDF, Frequency counts.
However to make the predicting models better we used Embeddings which we created from the scratch as well as used alreay existing open sourced embeddings available.
We have alo created a few Natual Language generation models also where in either individual characters are generated per step or complete word is generated.
